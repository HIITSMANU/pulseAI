        <p><strong>PulseAI</strong> is the first global <strong>non-profit organisation established to provide a voice for those living with or affected by cardiovascular disease. We are an alliance of heart patient organisations, aiming to create a unified global voice for those living with or affected by heart disease.</strong> <br><br>

            Our aim is to unite patient groups from around the world under the umbrella of Global Heart Hub. Our combined mission is to raise awareness of heart disease and the challenges it presents in everyday life.

We aim to increase awareness and understanding of the many heart conditions that exist, improve patient outcomes, enhance quality of life, and optimise longevity and healthy ageing.</p>
